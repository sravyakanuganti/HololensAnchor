# HololensAnchor
In this we can create have a world anchor attached to a physical space in the real world.
If you want to move the anchor to a different location or rotate the anchor, we can use "Move Anchor" voice command.
Once the anchor is rotated/moved, we can use "Attach Anchor" voice command to fix the anchor. 
We can a picture using this application. It stores the picture in the hololens. Along with that the position of the camera w.r.t to the anchor when the picture is taken is stored in a text file "coordinates.txt". The voice command for taking picture is "Take Photo".
